INSTALLATION
============
1. Set the needed paths and ENV variables in your ".bashrc" file:

export PATH="$HOME/l1vm/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/l1vm/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export L1VM_ROOT="$HOME/l1vm/"

This sets the "~/l1vm" directory in your "/home" directory as the home for L1VM. Which is the default.

2. Choose one of the build scripts in "install" directory for your OS.
On Debian Linux for example use:

$ ./install-debian.sh

The installer scripts need "sudo" to install the needed libraries.
You have to make sure that sudo works on your system!

Have fun!
