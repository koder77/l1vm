L1VM PORTABLE
=============
The "run-prog.sh" script can be called with a program name.
It sets the L1VM paths to the directory it is in.
So the portable L1VM in it can be run.

To make this work copy the following directories in it:

bin, include, lib and prog

The needed binaries and the modules must be in "bin".

Then run the program with the "run-prog.sh" script.
