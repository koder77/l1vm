L1VM PORTABLE
=============
Copy the scripts into the root directory of a "l1vm" directory.
You can put both binaries for Linux and Windows on a USB stick for example:

bin-linux and bin-windows

And then on Linux for example go into the root directory of L1VM.
Now run "source ./set-path-linux.sh" in the shell.
Then you can run the l1vm:

$ l1vm hello

This way you can put both Linux and Windows ports onto one USB stick.
