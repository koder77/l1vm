L1VM - SDL 3.x README
=====================
NOTE: this is a WIP!
I did change the code in sdl.c to the new SDL 3.x library.
The code in gui.c is a WIP. I don't know when or if it will be ported to SDL 3.x.

I could now compile the library. The lines demo program runs fine, so "sdl.c" is ok!
But the GUI program pov-edit just puts garbage into the window. The texts are not rendered at all!

I need help to do this! If you know how to port this code from SDL 2.x to 3.x then please contact me: info@midnight-coding.de.
