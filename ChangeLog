This leaves out some instructions in the assembly output, resulting in a speedup.

New: Added clang toolchain in: clang-8.0.1. Just use the bash script there.
It downloads, compiles and installs clang to your /home directory in: l1vm-clang.
There is no root right needed to install!
The makefiles are copied at the script end.

C0DEBABE00002019

So in order to run older programs you have to recompile them!

New: two scripts in prog/ directory:
compile.sh to compile and assemble programs:
$ ./compile.sh foobar

And "build-all.sh" to compile and assemble all programs in prog/ directory.
Bugfix: memory_bounds memory access checker now should work!
