OTP crypt
=========
Here are two programs for OTP (one time pad) encryption/decryption.

With make-otp you can generate a key file with random data.
With crypt-otp you can encrypt/decrypt the files.

NOTE: A key file must at least have the size of the file you want to encrypt or decrypt. Always check if the output file has the same size as the input file.
