INSTALLATION README
===================
This is "POV Edit" my POV 8 red pattern editor for my latest POV LED project.
If you are interested in my LED POV hardware then write me a mail.

Copy "pov-edit-4.l1com" to your "/prog" L1VM folder.
Copy "pov-edit" directory into your "home/user/l1vm" folder.

Now build the pov edit program:

```
$ ./build-l1vm.sh pov-edit-4
```

And run the editor:

```
$ l1vm prog/pov-edit-4
```

Have some fun!
