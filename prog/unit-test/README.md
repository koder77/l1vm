UNIT TEST DEMO
==============

This shows how to do simple unit tests with a function in a header file.
So with something like this you can write safer code.

Copy the bash script "test-compare.sh" to "~/l1vm/bin".
Then run "multiply-test.sh" to run the unit test.
The output of the program is checked with "multiply-test.txt" (the correct output)!
