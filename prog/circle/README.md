Math circle bignum 4
====================
Installation
------------
This version uses Pi with 100000 decimal places. This is possible with the new string handling in my VM.

Go to this website: http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~huberty/math5337/groupe/digits.html
Save it as "pi-100000.html" and copy it into a "~/l1vm/pi/" directory inside the L1VM home directory.

Then build the program with: "l1vm-build.sh math-circle-bignum-4".

Usage
-----
To run it: "l1vm math-circle-bignum-4".

You need to download the file from:
https://www.angio.net/pi/digits.html

Copy the file https://assets.angio.net/pi1000000.txt into your l1vm home directory: "~/l1vm/pi/".

The build of the program is done as for the older version above.
