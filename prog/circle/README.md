Math circle bignum 4
====================
Installation
------------
This version uses Pi with 100000 decimal places. This is possible with the new string handling in my VM.

Go to this website: http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~huberty/math5337/groupe/digits.html
Save it as "pi-100000.html" and copy it into a "~/l1vm/pi/" directory inside the L1VM home directory.

Then build the program with: "l1vm-build.sh math-circle-bignum-4".

Usage
-----
To run it: "l1vm math-circle-bignum-4".
