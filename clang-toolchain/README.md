MAKE TOOLCHAIN
==============
In this directory is a usefull script that downloads and installs a clang 12.0 toolchain in
your home directory: "l1vm-clang-12.0.0/".

To run a full build you have to run: "install-toolchain.sh" in the root directory of L1VM.

The needed env variables are exported to "CC" (clang) and "CCPP" (clang++).
